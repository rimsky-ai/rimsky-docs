# Named event

## What it is

A named event is a non-terminal executor emission carrying a name (a string drawn from the executor's `declared_events` capability) and an inert payload. Persisted to a named-event ledger (with inline/handle spill via the blob backend, see `concept:blob-backend`). Two consumption paths: attribute substitution (`{{nodes.<emitter>.event.<name>.<json_path>}}`) and subscription to the event (see `concept:node-subscription`). Inertness discipline cross-linked at `concept:inertness`.

## Purpose

A graph node's executor often produces signal worth driving other nodes mid-run (progress events, per-step scores, partial outputs). Rolling them into the terminal vocabulary would couple them to dispatch lifecycle; a separate non-terminal channel keeps them clean.

## Boundaries

Owns: the emission protocol surface, the persistence ledger, the two consumption paths, the `declared_events` registration cross-check. Does NOT own: terminal events (those close the stream), audit log shape (see `event-log`). Adjacent: `executor`, `node-subscription`, `event-log`, `attribute` (substitution consumer), `blob-backend` (spill).

## Invariants

- Event payloads are inert in rimsky (`@blessed-invariant 21`). Read only at the sanctioned substitution leaf and the persistence-layer fetch.
- Most-recent emission of `(emitter, name)` wins at substitution time; full history retained in the ledger.
- Event subscription names are cross-checked against the executor's `declared_events` capability at template registration when the executor is reachable; unknown event names at runtime are treated as no-ops.

## Ledger storage

The persisted form of named events is an append-only ledger keyed by emitter node-type + event name + sequence, with each record carrying either the inline payload or a spill handle plus the backend that holds it. Payloads can be spilled via the configured blob backend (one of inline, Postgres large-object, filesystem, or in-memory — see `concept:blob-backend`). Read by attribute substitution `{{nodes.<emitter>.event.<name>.<path>}}` and by event subscriptions (see `concept:node-subscription`).

Inertness discipline (`@blessed-invariant 21`, see `concept:inertness`): the payload bytes are inert in rimsky — read only via the sanctioned substitution leaf and the persistence-layer fetch on event consumption. Never logged, formatted as a value, validated beyond schema gates, transformed, attached to traces, or included in error messages.

Most-recent emission of `(emitter, event_name)` wins at substitution time. No built-in retention; operator-managed.

## Notes

- 2026-05-14: consumption paths updated. Two paths today are substitution + on_event-handler-invalidate; under the new model: substitution (unchanged) + subscription-to-event (`subscribes: [{node: <sender>, type: event/<name>}]`, see `concept:node-subscription`). The former on-event-handler concept is dropped (retired). Per `spec:2026-05-14-subscription-cascade-and-quality-of-life-design`.
- 2026-05-15: **events are internal-to-rimsky and frame-synchronous; distinct from messages (external, frame-bounded)**. A named event is emitted mid-run by an executor and consumed in the same frame via substitution or subscription; it never crosses an instance boundary and never creates a new frame. A `concept:message` is the boundary-crossing dispatch unit (operator API, publisher-origin message via the message-emit endpoint with `sender_kind: "publisher"`); it enqueues into the message ledger and creates a frame at delivery. The retired `on_event:` map path is fully retired; consumption is via `subscribes: [{type: event/<name>, ...}]` only. Templates that reference the retired map path get reject class `on_event_map_retired_use_subscribes` at registration.
- 2026-05-25 — Codebase citations removed + cross-refs repaired for self-containment per spec:2026-05-25-concept-doc-self-containment.
