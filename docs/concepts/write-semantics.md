# Write semantics

## What it is

A per-claim enum (`sync | staged_async | blocking_async | read_only`) that determines how the coexistence matrix treats concurrent claims on byte-equal claim scope (per `concept:claim-scope`). Three-level structure: the producer advertises an allowed-values set through its capabilities; the operator declares a narrowing allowed-values set per producer in deployment config (the `write_semantics_allowed` setting); each open verb returns one realized value in its acquisition result.

### Per-value semantics

The four realized values, with their concurrency consequences:

- **`sync`** — synchronous in-place writes; no staging area. Two writers on byte-equal claim scope conflict (the coexistence predicate returns false for sync↔sync, sync↔staged_async, sync↔blocking_async). A read claim conflicts with a sync writer.
- **`staged_async`** — writes go to a producer-internal staging area; reads can dispatch concurrently with writes on the same claim scope (the reader sees the pre-stage snapshot). Two writers still conflict; reads and writers coexist. Honest support requires snapshot delegation or native MVCC pass-through — the reader-lease internal-serialization pattern is forbidden (`@blessed-invariant 9b`).
- **`blocking_async`** — staging area present, but reads block until commit. Two writers conflict; reads and writers serialize. The right answer when the producer can stage but cannot offer point-in-time snapshots to readers.
- **`read_only`** — read-only access; the producer will reject any write attempt. Two readers coexist trivially.

## Purpose

A single per-binary capability is too coarse (a postgres producer might support `sync` for some resources and `staged_async` for others); per-claim with no upper bound is unbounded. The three-level allowed-values structure pins what the producer claims to support, what the operator allows, and what each specific claim got.

## Boundaries

Owns: the enum values, the envelope handshake, the realized-per-claim value, the conflict-matrix input. Does NOT own: claim-scope conflict comparison (see `concept:claim-scope`), claim disposition (see `concept:claim-producer`), per-claim payload (see `concept:claim`). Adjacent: `concept:claim`, `concept:claim-producer`, `concept:claim-scope`, `concept:claim-handle`.

## Invariants

- The operator-declared allowed set ⊆ producer-advertised set (validated at startup; fails fast).
- `UNKNOWN` is the wire zero value; producers must not return it; the supervisor rejects it.
- Byte-equal-scope uniformity: two open-verb calls with byte-equal claim scope MUST return the same realized value.
- Reader-lease internal serialization is forbidden for `staged_async` — honest support requires snapshot delegation or MVCC pass-through (`@blessed-invariant 9b`).

## Aliases and historical names

Pre-`spec:2026-05-12-nomenclature-resolution` Group C, the operator-facing config key was the "write-semantics envelope" (with a single-value shortcut accepted as a one-element list). Both forms are retired: the canonical key is the "write-semantics allowed" setting, and the single-value shortcut is rejected with a precise error message. The corresponding capabilities field was renamed to match.

## Notes

- Write-semantics-envelope → write-semantics-allowed key rename per `spec:2026-05-12-nomenclature-resolution` Group C.2. Single-value config shortcut retired per Group C.1.
- [2026-05-18] Folded content from the former standalone public-docs page (now retired) — four-value plain-English breakdown (per-value semantics with concurrency consequences) added as a subsection under "What it is".
- 2026-05-22 — Updated for ClaimScope rename per spec:2026-05-22-fan-out-safety-scope-first: "byte-equal scope" references qualified to "byte-equal claim scope"; the adjacency to the former `scope` concept rewritten to `concept:claim-scope`.
- 2026-05-25 — Codebase citations removed + cross-refs repaired for self-containment per spec:2026-05-25-concept-doc-self-containment.
