# Async-callback wrong key

## What it means

An executor posted to the supervisor's async-callback URL with body keyed `kind:` instead of `type:`. The supervisor's callback route enforces the exact key `type:` and rejects any other key.

## When it happens

When implementing an executor that uses the async-callback path. The executor's body shape must match the supervisor's expectation. A common mistake: copying the streaming-event Go struct (which uses `kind`) into the callback body when JSON-encoding it.

## What to do

Change the body key from `kind` to `type`. The claude-agent reference executor (now in the separate `rimsky-services` repository, under `executors/claude-agent/`) and its test suite cover the exact wire shape; align with that.
