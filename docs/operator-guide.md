# Operator guide

This guide collects operator-visible knobs that span multiple concepts.
For per-concept references, see `docs/concepts/`. For protocol
implementation, see `docs/protocols/`.

## Configuration root: `RIMSKY_CONFIG`

Each rimsky binary reads its deployment-shape config from
`RIMSKY_CONFIG` (default `/etc/rimsky/rimsky.yml`). The unified file
declares persistence, named-locks, claim-producers, and executors.
A reference config ships at `deploy/rimsky.yml`.

Per-process tuning (concurrency, callback host, heartbeat) lives in
each process's own YAML or env vars and is read separately
(e.g. `RIMSKY_SUPERVISOR_CONFIG` for `rimsky-supervisor`).

## Persistence: blob backend

The `persistence.blob` block selects how attribute values, parked-state
payloads, and named-event payloads are stored when they exceed the
inline-spill threshold:

```yaml
persistence:
  driver: postgres
  postgres:
    dsn: ...
  blob:
    backend: pg-largeobject  # inline | pg-largeobject | filesystem | memory
    spill_threshold_bytes: 65536
    filesystem:
      root: /var/lib/rimsky/blobs
    pg_largeobject:
      schema: public
    retention:
      orphan_sweep_interval: 1h
      retention_after_unreferenced: 24h
```

Backend choices:

- `inline` — the default. No spill; large attribute values stay in the
  attribute table inline. Suitable for small-attribute workloads.
- `pg-largeobject` — postgres-large-object backend. Suitable for
  multi-host deployments. Uses the same DSN as the persistence driver.
- `filesystem` — files written under `filesystem.root`. Requires a
  shared volume in multi-host deployments.
- `memory` — in-process map. **Dev-only**: rejected at startup unless
  `RIMSKY_PROCESS_ROLE=unified` (set by `rimsky-entrypoint`). The
  per-process binaries (`rimsky-scheduler`, `rimsky-supervisor`,
  `rimsky-control-api`) cannot share state through an in-process map,
  so the gate prevents accidental misconfiguration.

`SweepOrphanedBlobs` runs in the foundation tick loop and reaps blob
handles whose retention window has elapsed. The blob backend itself
sees only `Delete(handle)`.

## claude-agent: configuration

The `claude-agent` reference executor is configured two ways: process
environment at startup, and per-node attributes at dispatch time. It
has no separate config file or catalog of external MCP servers.

**Startup environment.** Set on the executor process (the
`claude-agent` service in `deploy/`):

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — at least one is
  required in non-stub mode; the executor refuses to start without one.
  In API-key mode the key is written to a 0600 temp file behind an
  `apiKeyHelper` and never enters the spawned `claude` process's
  environment.
- `RIMSKY_EXECUTOR_STUB_MODE=1` — stub mode: the executor spawns no
  `claude` subprocess and returns a canned completion. The published
  `deploy/` stack ships claude-agent in stub mode.
- `RIMSKY_EXECUTOR_HOST`, `RIMSKY_EXECUTOR_PORT_GRPC` (default `9090`),
  `RIMSKY_EXECUTOR_PORT_HTTP` (default `9190`) — bind addresses for the
  gRPC executor and the HTTP+JSON bridge.
- `RIMSKY_EXECUTOR_SILENCE_MS` (default `120000`) — how long the
  subprocess may produce no stdout before the silence-tracker acts.
- `RIMSKY_DISPATCH_MAX_USD` — deployment-wide spend cap forwarded to the
  CLI as `--max-budget-usd`. A per-node `cli.max_budget_usd` attribute
  wins over this when set.

**Per-node attributes.** Templates drive each dispatch through the
node's `attributes`, not through an operator catalog. The executor
reads `model`, `system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, and an optional `cli.*`
sub-object that tunes the spawned `claude` CLI: `cli.bare`,
`cli.permission_mode`, `cli.allowed_tools`, `cli.disallowed_tools`,
`cli.add_dirs`, `cli.max_budget_usd`, `cli.handle_rate_limits`, and
`cli.max_schema_corrections`. Each maps to a `claude` CLI flag (or a
recovery behavior); rimsky never inspects the values. The full
expected-attributes schema is defined by the claude-agent executor
itself (in-tree at `lib/services/executors/claude-agent/`); see
[`docs/agents/examples/claude-agent-attribute-defaults.md`](agents/examples/claude-agent-attribute-defaults.md)
for a worked example of how attribute defaults flow through it.

**MCP wiring.** The executor wires exactly one MCP server into each
dispatch: its own internal `rimsky-callback` (an HTTP MCP server it
hosts), through which the agent reports terminal outcomes
(`report_complete`, `report_error`, `report_blocked`, `report_park`),
emits named events, and reads/writes node attributes. There is no
operator-configured catalog of external MCP servers, and templates
cannot register additional MCP servers for a dispatch to reach.

## Observability: Prometheus metrics

Each rimsky binary can expose a `/metrics` endpoint:

- `rimsky-control-api` — `RIMSKY_METRICS_PORT` (0 = disabled, default).
  Bound to the same host as the control API.
- `rimsky-scheduler` — `RIMSKY_METRICS_PORT` and `RIMSKY_METRICS_HOST`
  (default `127.0.0.1`).
- `rimsky-supervisor` — same as scheduler.

The metric set is documented in `lib/control/observability/metrics.go`.
Counters cover dispatches, terminal verdicts, invalidates, claim
acquisitions. Gauges cover nodes-by-state, parked-by-reason, held
frames, dispatch queue depth. Histograms cover dispatch latency,
claim acquisition latency, frame duration, and parked-duration-on-
resume.

## Diagnostic endpoints

The control API exposes:

- `GET /admin/diagnostics/held-frames` — frames currently held.
- `GET /admin/diagnostics/parked-nodes` — parked nodes; optional
  `?reason=<name>` filter.
- `POST /admin/instances/{instance}/nodes/{node_id}/invalidate` — admin
  invalidate. Dispatches by node state: `parked` resumes,
  `fresh` invalidates, `running`/`failed` returns 409.
- `POST /admin/lineage/prune` — prune lineage records.

`/admin/instances/{instance}/nodes/{node_id}/invalidate` is the
general-purpose admin invalidation surface for any node state. (There is
no scheduled-node `force-fire` route — template-level schedules were
retired; cron firing now lives in the standalone `sensor-cron` publisher
service, which sources its own messages.)

## Conformance probes

The conformance probes are subcommands of the `rimsky` CLI —
`rimsky conformance <protocol> ...`. (They were folded in from the
former standalone `cmd/rimsky-*-conformance` binaries; the underlying
runners remain importable as Go libraries under
`lib/protocols/conformance/...`.) The protocols:

- `rimsky conformance executor` — exercises an executor against the
  protocol. Stub mode is mandatory for LLM-calling executors
  (`--require-stub-mode`).
- `rimsky conformance claim-producer` — exercises a claim-producer.
- `rimsky conformance publisher` — exercises a publisher (`--kind`).
- `rimsky conformance validation` — exercises the Validation mix-in.
- `rimsky conformance data-processing` — exercises the DataProcessing mix-in.
- `rimsky conformance blob-backend` — exercises a blob backend
  against the `BlobBackend` interface (in-process; pass
  `--backend <name>` plus the backend's required config).
- `rimsky conformance probe` — the protocol-agnostic stub-mode probe.

Each exits 0 on all checks passing.

## Pre-v1 caveats

- No Helm chart or Kubernetes manifests ship yet. The reference deploy
  surface is the docker-compose stack at `deploy/docker-compose.yml`;
  a chart is on the roadmap but not published.
- The unified image (`rimsky-all-in-one`, built `FROM` the multi-role `rimsky`
  image) defaults to SQLite at `/var/lib/rimsky/state.db`. Replicas > 1 break
  (independent SQLite databases). Use the per-process images plus the postgres
  driver for multi-replica deployments.
- Pre-v1 has no backwards-compat guarantees on schema or wire shapes.
  Migrations may drop and recreate tables.
