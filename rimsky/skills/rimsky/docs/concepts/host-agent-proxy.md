# Host agent proxy

## What it is

A rimsky-stack `concept:service` implementing the multi-protocol composition pattern (per `concept:service` invariants: distinct handler types per protocol, separately registered on one gRPC server). Presents the rimsky gRPC service protocols (`concept:executor`, `concept:claim-producer`, eventually `concept:publisher` / `concept:lifecycle-subscriber` / `concept:validation` / `concept:data-processing`) on the supervisor-facing side. Maintains agent connections on the dev-facing side via a new long-lived bidi-stream protocol (the agent-connection protocol). Routes dispatches to whichever agent is connected for the instance's owner. Declared in the rimsky config (`concept:rimsky-yml`) once per protocol it serves — an entry under the executor block, one under the claim-producer block, and so on, all pointing at the same binary.

## Purpose

Lets rimsky dispatch work to dev-machine binaries declared per-instance, without changing any supervisor or graph-processing code path. The proxy is the single architectural addition; supervisors, dispatch resolution, error vocabulary, and callback handling are unchanged.

## Boundaries

Owns: the agent ↔ proxy bidi-stream protocol, the spawn-lifecycle state machine, the per-instance service-bindings cache (populated via `concept:lifecycle-subscriber`), the per-protocol dispatch handlers that proxy through to spawned processes, the callback-URL rewriting that lets spawned processes post to the agent's local listener rather than dialing the supervisor. Does NOT own: the rimsky-side service protocols themselves (those are `concept:executor`, `concept:claim-producer`, etc.), the supervisor's dispatch logic, the per-instance state (that's `concept:instance`), the lifecycle-subscriber wire protocol (that's `concept:lifecycle-subscriber`). Adjacent: `concept:host-agent`, `concept:service`, `concept:executor`, `concept:claim-producer`, `concept:lifecycle-subscriber`, `concept:instance`, `concept:rimsky-yml`.

## Invariants

- Implemented via the existing multi-protocol composition pattern on `concept:service` — distinct handler types, no shared capabilities provider.
- One spawn per (run-scope, binding-name), lazy birth on first dispatch, run-scope-lifetime, reaped on run-scope termination.
- Routing resolves the serving agent by the instance owner's api-key for ordinary instances, OR — for owner-less instances created in `concept:anonymous-mode` — by a well-known anonymous routing identity under which the anonymous-mode agent registers. An owner-less-instance dispatch routes to that anonymous agent rather than hard-failing; anonymous mode and late-bound services are not mutually exclusive.
- All dispatch failures surface as executor-error / claim-producer-unavailable terminals on the supervisor-facing protocol — no new synthetic supervisor-side acquire error classes.
- The proxy is declared in the rimsky config per protocol it serves, using the same binary across all entries (one endpoint, N namespace registrations).
- The proxy is the URL-rewriting boundary for rimsky URLs handed to spawned processes (the callback URL specifically; other rimsky URLs follow the same principle as additional protocols are wired).
- The proxy is a transparent forwarder of every rimsky service protocol it fronts (`concept:executor`, `concept:claim-producer`, `concept:publisher`, `concept:validation`, `concept:data-processing`) by one uniform spawn/forward mechanism, each presenting exactly the fronted service's protocol. No protocol ships as a registered-but-unimplemented stub, and no per-protocol special-casing leaves some protocols unable to reach the spawn/forward path. A service that conforms to its own protocol works behind the proxy by construction — so the proxy adds no separate conformance surface (there is no host-agent / proxy conformance suite).

## Notes

- [2026-05-24] Concept created per spec 2026-05-24-host-agent-and-proxy-design. v1 implements `concept:executor` and `concept:claim-producer` supervisor-facing handlers (late-bound service fronting) plus `concept:lifecycle-subscriber` as the proxy's own consumer-role handler (consuming the instance-created event for the binding cache and the run-scope-terminal event for reap; the other lifecycle methods no-op with an acknowledgement). `concept:publisher` / `concept:validation` / `concept:data-processing` handlers ship registered but unimplemented. `concept:blob-backend` is intentionally excluded — it's an in-process Go interface, not a gRPC wire protocol.
- [2026-06-06] Dispatch routing now resolves the serving agent by the instance owner's api-key OR, for owner-less (anonymous-mode) instances, by a well-known anonymous routing identity — removing the prior lock-out where an owner-less instance's late-bind dispatch hard-failed with `host_agent_not_connected`. Per spec:2026-06-06-comprehensive-gap-closure.
- [2026-06-06] The "one spawn per (run-scope, binding-name) … reaped on run-scope termination" invariant is now actually enforced rather than aspirational: v1 threads the run-scope id onto the dispatch wire, so the proxy keys spawns by the real run-scope instead of collapsing all run-scopes of an instance onto one shared child. Concurrent run-scopes of a fanned-out instance therefore get distinct, isolated children, and reaping one run-scope's child leaves the others serving. Per spec:2026-06-06-comprehensive-gap-closure.
- [2026-06-06] Follow-on to the [2026-05-24] note: `concept:publisher` / `concept:validation` / `concept:data-processing` no longer ship registered-but-unimplemented. All five fronted protocols are now fully forwarded by the one uniform spawn/forward mechanism, each presenting exactly the fronted service's protocol — none returns `Unimplemented`. This makes the protocol-transparency invariant above real: a late-bound binary speaking any of these protocols works behind the proxy by construction. Per spec:2026-06-06-comprehensive-gap-closure.
