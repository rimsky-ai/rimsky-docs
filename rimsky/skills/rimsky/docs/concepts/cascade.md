# Cascade

## What it is

Cascade is the engine that turns one node-state transition into the set of downstream node-state transitions. Per the 2026-05-12 nomenclature resolution, three precise words name its parts:

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **walk** | The scheduler-tick-driven traversal of the graph (topology-ordered). The mechanism. |
| **propagation** | Cascade-of-stale on `fresh_changed`. Mark dependents stale and recurse — the handler for `concept:invalidate`. |
| **fallthrough** | No-dispatch fresh-roll on `pure_cascade`. Roll fresh state forward without running the node; detected per-node and executed by the scheduler's pure-cascade sweep. |

One walk; two node-level behaviors (propagation, fallthrough).

## Purpose

A reactive graph orchestrator only earns its keep if a single executor's "I changed" signal causes the right downstream nodes to recompute and no others. Cascade is the mechanism that turns one terminal outcome into the set of downstream node-state transitions.

## Boundaries

Owns: the firing-gate predicate, the downstream walk, the two node-level behaviors (propagation vs fallthrough). Does NOT own: invalidate emission (see `concept:invalidate`), frame scheduling (see `concept:frame`), terminal-handler resolution (see `concept:terminal-resolution`). Adjacent: `concept:invalidate`, `concept:signal`, `concept:transition-reason`, `concept:frame`, `concept:terminal-resolution`.

The cascade walker consults two edge maps — the subscription-edge map (existing) and the hard-dep edge map (added 2026-05-20). Both feed the wait-set with the same row shape. Subscription edges are keyed by sender node-type (downstream lookup from a transitioning sender); hard-dep edges are keyed by receiver node-type (upstream lookup from a freshly-invalidated receiver), so the walker can proactively invalidate upstreams that a receiver declares `hard_dep: true` on.

## Invariants

- Cascade fires iff a subscription edge matches the emitted signal's type AND the subscriber's CEL `when:` predicate evaluates true.
- Cascade always happens in a frame.
- The walk + per-node behaviors are scheduler actions; they are NOT configurable via the per-emit `frame: in | next` discipline.

> **Retracted 2026-05-23.** Under the subscriber-driven cascade-fire model introduced by spec:2026-05-23-signal-taxonomy-and-policy-decoupling-design, propagation is determined by subscriber matches against the emitted signal, not by sender color. Settled-color is informational. The functional equivalent (downstream nodes not auto-firing on a failed sender) is now expressed receiver-side via subscribers' `when:` predicates or via not subscribing to `terminal/error/*` at all. The matching retraction lives on `concept:parked-state`.

## Aliases and historical names

The phrase "reactive cascade" appears in sketches and human-facing onboarding docs. Internally, "cascade" is the unambiguous name. Pre-2026-05-12 prose sometimes referred to "two walks"; the current vocabulary is one walk + two node-level behaviors.

## Common pitfalls

- **Rimsky's cascade is not CSS cascade.** CSS's cascade resolves competing style rules by specificity and order; Rimsky's cascade propagates `invalidate` through the per-template subscription-edge inverse map. The two share a name and nothing else.
- Treating "recalculate" as a second message. There is one cascade message: `invalidate`. Recalculation is what the scheduler does next, not a service message that travels alongside.
- Expecting cascade to skip nodes whose new value would be byte-identical to the old. Cascade is subscription-driven, not value-diff-driven; the executor commits `changed: false` if it wants downstream subscribers that filter on `payload.changed` to suppress.
- Confusing cascade reach with executor invocation. Cascade marks nodes stale and inserts wait-set rows; the scheduler decides which stale nodes are eligible for dispatch (wait-set empty for the current frame, claims and locks acquirable).
- Treating `terminal/error/*` subscribers as automatically downstream-firing. Under the subscriber-driven cascade model, a subscriber filtering on `terminal/error/*` fires only if it has declared the subscription; the sender's color does not fire downstream nodes by itself. A node that wants to halt propagation on errors simply omits the subscription; a node that wants to act on every error subscribes broadly.

## Notes

- Three-word vocabulary (walk / propagation / fallthrough) introduced per `spec:2026-05-12-nomenclature-resolution` (audit cross-layer #10).
- 2026-05-14: the cascade walk's downstream traversal is driven by the per-template subscription-edge inverse map (see `concept:node-subscription`), not by a static dependency graph. Wait-set rows are inserted on every cascade-walk match (pessimistic invalidate); the bulk-delete-on-settled-state rule (see `concept:wait-set`) drains them as senders resolve. Eligibility = state=stale AND wait-set is empty for the current frame (predicate evaluated in the persistence-layer ready-for-dispatch sweep query). Per spec:2026-05-14-subscription-cascade-and-quality-of-life-design. (Superseded 2026-05-22: wait-set insertion now uses the affirm-then-read pattern — a run-row affirm step owns row allocation; the walker reads the affirmed row's id and inserts the wait-set row keyed by that id.)
- 2026-05-15: **sub-graph encapsulation**. Cascade walks descend through delegation (the calling node fires per its own subscriptions), but cascade does NOT cross the sub-graph boundary from outside. Outer subscriptions match against the calling node's state/events/attributes (populated from the parent run's lifecycle including the carried-up exit writeback per `concept:delegation`). Internal nodes within the sub-graph cascade normally among each other, with entry-alias references resolved to the calling node per-invocation. Cascade-boundary opacity is enforced at canonicalization: internal nodes referencing outer-graph nodes are rejected at template registration. See `concept:sub-graph`, `concept:delegation`.
- [2026-05-18] Folded content from a former external cascade doc (now retired) — common-pitfalls subsection (CSS-cascade disambiguation + recalculate/value-diff/dispatch-vs-cascade-reach pitfalls).
- 2026-05-20 — Hard-dep edge map. The cascade walker now consults a hard-dep edge map alongside the subscription edge map at registration. At runtime, when invalidating a receiver R, the walker iterates R's hard-dep edges (computed from R's attribute schema fields with `hard_dep: true`); for each (R, X) hard-dep edge where X has no current-frame run, the walker proactively invalidates X via an inline stale-mark + recursive cascade walk in the same transaction, then inserts a wait-set blocker on R. See spec:2026-05-20-attribute-pull-resolution-design.
- 2026-05-22 — Reshape per spec:2026-05-22-fan-out-safety-scope-first-design: cascade walker is RunScope-aware (per `concept:run-scope`). For each subscription edge the walker computes a target RunScope (same-RunScope is the common case; cross-RunScope at sub-graph entry-success and fan-out parent settlement), then affirms the receiver's run row for that RunScope and frame to ensure it exists, reads its id, and inserts the wait-set row keyed by the resolved id. The stale-mark step simplifies to a pure update keyed by run id (no insert path; allocation is owned by the affirm step).
- 2026-05-23 — Reshape per spec:2026-05-23-signal-taxonomy-and-policy-decoupling-design. Cascade-fire predicate becomes subscriber match (`concept:signal`); the sender-side fresh-changed gate retires. Filter evaluation moves to walk-time (CEL predicates against signal payload); the pessimistic-invalidate rule (insert wait-set rows regardless of filter) retires in favor of subscriber-driven matching. The "cascade does not propagate from parked or failed" invariant retracts — propagation is subscriber-driven, not sender-color-driven (the matching retraction lives on `concept:parked-state`). Walker now fires once per emitted signal (terminal/success + one attribute/<key>/changed per merged attribute + one event/<name> per emitted named event); a once-per-frame guard (a visited set within the per-terminal loop plus an existing-run probe across terminals) prevents multi-signal fan-out from re-affirming the same receiver. Common pitfalls refreshed to remove lifecycle-handler and last-outcome references.
- 2026-05-25 — Codebase citations removed + cross-refs repaired for self-containment per spec:2026-05-25-concept-doc-self-containment.
- 2026-06-06 — The cascade walker's in-frame join now has an operator-sourced entry point (operator frame:in), alongside the existing cascade-sourced in-frame joins (post-success self-invalidate, hard-dep pull). The boundary: cascade-sourced joins resolve the frame from the source node's run row; the operator-sourced join resolves the instance's currently-running frame directly (no source node). Per spec:2026-06-06-comprehensive-gap-closure-design.
